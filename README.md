# DynamicInjectionBasedOnQualifiers
Showing how to do dynamic injection of a specific implementation (e.g. dummy or real implementation) depending on certain criterias (e.g. current environment is test? Or prod? Or ...) by using qualifiers.
Dynamic means: Without re-deploying your application!

Learned from Adam Bien. Thanks!
